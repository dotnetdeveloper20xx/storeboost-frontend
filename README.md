# üì± StoreBoost Appointment Booking ‚Äì User Overview & Stories

## üßæ What is StoreBoost?

**StoreBoost** is a modern web application that allows users to view, book, and manage appointment time slots.

Built using **React + Vite**, the app leverages **Tailwind CSS** for styling, **React Query** for API state, **Zustand** for minimal client state, and **react-hook-form + zod** for interactive and validated forms.

# üì¶ StoreBoost Request-Response Architecture 

This document provides a detailed walkthrough of every API request, how it is handled in the frontend code, and how it fits into the broader architecture and developer principles of the StoreBoost React application.

---

## üîó Base API URL

```
https://localhost:7009/api
```

---

## 1. `GET /slots` ‚Äî Fetch All Slots

### Purpose
Retrieve all appointment slots (booked and available).

### Frontend Flow

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `src/features/slots/api/slotApi.ts` | `fetchAllSlots()` sends GET request |
| `src/features/slots/hooks/useAllSlots.ts` | React Query hook manages fetching and caching |
| `SlotCard.tsx` | Renders individual slot UI |
| `AllSlotsPage.tsx` | Calls hook and renders list |

### Developer Principles
- Server state separation via React Query
- Reusable UI components
- Declarative data fetching

---

## 2. `GET /slots/available` ‚Äî Fetch Available Slots

### Purpose
Show only slots that are still open for booking.

### Frontend Flow

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `slotApi.ts` | `fetchAvailableSlots()` |
| `useAvailableSlots.ts` | Custom React Query hook |
| `AvailableSlotsPage.tsx` | Page displaying filtered slot cards |

---

## 3. `POST /slots` ‚Äî Create New Slot (Admin)

### Purpose
Allows admin users to define new time slots.

### Frontend Flow

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `SlotForm.tsx` | Form using `react-hook-form` + `zod` |
| `useCreateSlot.ts` | Mutation hook to create slot |
| `AdminPage.tsx` | Hosts form and success banner |

### Request
```json
{
  "startTime": "2025-08-02T14:00:00Z",
  "maxBookings": 3
}
```

### Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Slot created successfully.",
  "data": "guid"
}
```

### Developer Principles
- Schema-based validation
- Localized success banners
- Separation of form and API logic

---

## 4. `POST /slots/{slotId}/book` ‚Äî Book a Slot

### Purpose
Book a specific appointment slot by its ID.

### Frontend Flow

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `slotApi.ts` | `bookSlot(id)` API function |
| `useBookSlot.ts` | React Query mutation hook |
| `SlotCard.tsx` | Contains button logic and loading state |

### Success Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Slot booked successfully.",
  "data": true
}
```

### Failure Response
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Slot is already fully booked."
}
```

---

## 5. `POST /slots/{slotId}/cancel` ‚Äî Cancel Booking

### Purpose
Cancel a user's existing booking.

### Frontend Flow

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `slotApi.ts` | `cancelBooking(id)` method |
| `useCancelBooking.ts` | Mutation + cache invalidation |
| `SlotCard.tsx` | Displays "Cancel" button if booked |

### Success Response
