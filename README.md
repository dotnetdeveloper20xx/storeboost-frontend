# 📘 Step 1: Project Initialization with Vite + React + TypeScript

## ✅ What we did:
We bootstrapped a new React project using Vite and TypeScript with the following commands:

```bash
npm create vite@latest storeboost-frontend -- --template react-ts
cd storeboost-frontend
npm install
```

---

## ❓ Why we did this:

### 🔷 Vite
- Offers ultra-fast startup and HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
- Uses `esbuild` — faster builds and dev server than Webpack (used in CRA)
- Lightweight, zero-config out of the box

### 🔷 TypeScript
- Enforces strong typing and self-documenting code
- Helps avoid runtime errors by catching mistakes early
- Improves IDE experience (autocomplete, type hints)

### 🔷 Naming
We named the project `storeboost-frontend` to align with the backend and product domain (`StoreBoost` appointment system).

---

## 🛠 How it helps:

- Enables usage of modern tools like Zustand, React Query
- Supports scalable folder structures and type-safe API interaction
- Fast reloads and modular builds improve dev efficiency

---

## 📁 Files generated:

- `index.html`, `main.tsx`, `App.tsx`: App entry
- `vite.config.ts`: Vite config
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript setup

---

## 🧠 Developer Principles Applied:

| Principle | How |
|----------|-----|
| Modern DX | Chose Vite over CRA for speed and developer experience |
| Type Safety | Used TypeScript for type-first architecture |
| Lean & Scalable | Started from minimal base to control dependencies |


# 📘 Step 2: Install Core Dependencies & Tailwind Setup

## ✅ What we did:

Installed essential frontend dependencies for state, styling, networking, and server state management:

```bash
npm install axios react-hot-toast zustand @tanstack/react-query
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

---

## ❓ Why we did this:

### 🔧 Axios
- Simplifies HTTP requests compared to `fetch()`.
- Supports interceptors and automatic JSON transformation.
- Centralized way to access backend APIs.

### 🔔 react-hot-toast
- Non-intrusive toast notifications.
- Perfect for showing feedback (e.g., “Slot created successfully!”).
- Later replaced by a custom banner.

### ⚙️ Zustand
- Lightweight alternative to Redux.
- Perfect for simple global UI state (e.g., selected slot ID).
- No boilerplate, very ergonomic for React.

### 🔁 @tanstack/react-query
- Handles **server state**: caching, refetching, and background updates.
- Eliminates the need for `useEffect + useState` patterns.
- Automatically syncs with backend changes.

### 🎨 Tailwind CSS + PostCSS + Autoprefixer
- Utility-first CSS framework for scalable and responsive styling.
- Promotes consistent UI and removes need for CSS-in-JS or global SCSS.
- PostCSS and Autoprefixer required for Tailwind to compile CSS.

---

## 🛠 How it helps:

- React Query improves network sync and UX.
- Zustand keeps shared client state simple.
- Tailwind makes component layout fast and responsive.
- Axios abstracts all API networking.

| Principle              | How                                                                 |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| State Separation       | Zustand for UI state, React Query for remote/server state            |
| Reusable Networking    | Axios methods encapsulated in API layer (`/api`)                     |
| Utility-First Styling  | Tailwind used instead of verbose or unscalable CSS/SCSS              |
| Clean Architecture     | React Query hooks for fetching, Zustand store for minimal app state  |


# 📘 Step 3: Tailwind CSS Configuration & Styling Setup

## ✅ What we did:

1. Updated `tailwind.config.js` to define which files Tailwind should scan for class names:
```js
export default {
  content: ['./index.html', './src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'],
  theme: { extend: {} },
  plugins: [],
}
```

2. Added Tailwind directives to `src/index.css`:
```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

3. Verified Tailwind setup by styling the `<App />` component with Tailwind utility classes.

---

## ❓ Why we did this:

### Tailwind CSS
- Offers **utility-first** styling: `p-4`, `text-xl`, `rounded-lg`, etc.
- Removes the need for writing custom CSS or managing component SCSS files.
- Enforces consistency across all UI components.
- Built for responsiveness and theming from the ground up.

### Content Paths in `tailwind.config.js`
- Tailwind needs to know **which files to scan** for class names.
- Limiting to `src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}` avoids bloated CSS output.

### `@tailwind` directives in `index.css`
- These import Tailwind’s styles at the base level of the application.
- Allows us to use Tailwind utilities in any component.

---

## 🛠 How it helps:

- Enables **rapid prototyping** and production-quality UIs using only class names.
- Scales better than CSS modules or styled-components in team settings.
- Developers can focus on UI behavior instead of writing/revising CSS.

## 🧠 Developer Principles Applied:

| Principle              | How                                                                 |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Utility-First Design   | All UIs are composed with Tailwind utilities                        |
| Consistency by Default | All layouts follow Tailwind’s spacing, font, and color scale        |
| Developer Velocity     | Design + layout done in JSX, with zero context switching            |
| Zero CSS Debt          | Avoids legacy `styles.css`, `theme.scss`, or unused class bloat     |

# 📘 Step 4: Project Folder Structure & Architecture

## ✅ What we did:

Created a modular, scalable folder structure following feature-sliced and atomic principles:

```
src/
├── app/               # Global setup: Zustand store, React Query client
├── features/slots/    # All slot-related logic and UI
│   ├── api/           # API methods (axios)
│   ├── hooks/         # React Query & Zustand hooks
│   ├── components/    # SlotCard, SlotForm, etc.
│   ├── pages/         # Route-level components (AllSlotsPage, AdminPage)
│   └── model/         # Shared types like Slot interface
├── shared/ui/         # Reusable UI components (e.g., CustomToaster)
├── styles/            # Tailwind/base styles (optional)
├── main.tsx           # App entry with providers
└── App.tsx            # App shell with routes
```

---

## ❓ Why we did this:

### 🔸 Feature-Sliced Architecture
- Code is grouped by **feature** not by type.
- This improves modularity and encapsulation.
- Example: `features/slots/` contains everything related to booking slots.

### 🔸 Separation of Concerns
- `api/`: Axios functions for backend calls
- `hooks/`: Custom hooks for data fetching or state
- `components/`: UI pieces that use those hooks
- `pages/`: Routed views used in React Router

### 🔸 Shared Layer (`shared/ui/`)
- Cross-feature UI elements (e.g., buttons, toasters)
- Enables design system reuse without duplication

### 🔸 app/
- Holds **global application context**, like Zustand store and React Query client setup.

---

## 🛠 How it helps:

- Makes the project easy to scale and test
- Enables feature-based collaboration (e.g., 2 devs working on different features)
- Reduces context switching by keeping related logic together

## 🧠 Developer Principles Applied:

| Principle              | How                                                                 |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Encapsulation  | All slot logic (API, UI, hooks) lives in `features/slots/`          |
| Separation of Concerns | `app/`, `shared/`, and `features/*` divide responsibilities clearly |
| Scalability            | Easy to add more features like users, analytics, etc.               |
| Maintainability        | Small, reusable, self-contained modules                             |

# 📘 Step 5: API Integration – Fetching Slots with React Query

## ✅ What we did:

1. Created an API method to call `GET /slots`
```ts
// src/features/slots/api/slotApi.ts
export const fetchAllSlots = async () => {
  const response = await axios.get('/api/slots');
  return response.data.data;
};
```

2. Built a custom React Query hook to use this method:
```ts
// src/features/slots/hooks/useAllSlots.ts
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';
export const useAllSlots = () => {
  return useQuery(['slots'], fetchAllSlots);
};
```

3. Created a `SlotCard` component to display each slot.
4. Rendered all slots using the `useAllSlots()` hook in the main UI.

---

## ❓ Why we did this:

### React Query
- Handles **server state**: fetching, caching, background updates.
- Automatically manages loading, error, and refetching states.
- Eliminates need for manual `useEffect + useState` combo.

### Axios
- Encapsulates HTTP logic so UI code stays clean.
- Future-proofed for token headers, retries, etc.

### SlotCard Component
- Visual display of one slot (date, time, bookings, status).
- Decoupled UI that consumes props and handles conditional styles.

---

## 🛠 How it helps:

- All API calls are declarative and cached by React Query.
- Data stays fresh without reloading the page.
- UI is reactive and automatically re-renders on slot updates.

| Principle              | How                                                                 |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Server State Separation| API state handled by React Query, not by local component state       |
| Reusability            | `useAllSlots()` can be used across pages (home, admin, available)   |
| Composable UI          | `SlotCard` used in lists, admin views, etc.                         |
| Declarative Data Fetching | React Query + Axios makes fetch logic expressive and composable   |
